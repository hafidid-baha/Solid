interface sugregation principle

"no client should be forced to depends on method it does not use"

witch means instead of one big interface we should splite our interface into small
interfaces

in these case we have to type of aniamls (birds,Reptiles)
+ master calss is animale
    + color
    + numOfLegs
    + name
    
+ animale class is a generale class so the bird ans Reptiles must extends this class
